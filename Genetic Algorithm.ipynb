    "The fitness function we are using is a small simulation. On an infinite plane, there is one food and one agent. The agent's behavior is controlled by the chromosome. The chromosome is broken into small pieces and used to build a neural network. The network is given the agents position, agent's velocity and the position of the food. The goal of the agent is to eat the food as many times as it can in a certain timeframe. Each time it eats the food, a new food will be spawned in a set area.\n",
